# nitro-generator-and-checker
This was made for a friend, the README file is for those who do not have discord.py and python installed. It is a quick way to start the code up without any experience

STEP 1: Copy the nitrogenandcheck.py file's code
STEP 2: open https://repl.it/ and create an account
STEP 3: Click the [+ NEW REPL] button, and paste the code in your auto-created `main.py` file
STEP 4: It's going to take a bit, since repl.it is automatically installing the modules that being imported, updating the already existing ones, and removing the ones that aren't needed
STEP 5: Click the Run button
STEP 6: When prompted, type how many codes you want to be generated and checked
STEP 7: Have fun with your discord nitro generator! There is no limit to how many codes you can create but make sure it doesn't go too high or your device dies.
# Happy Generating!
